Data Cleaning

In this section, you will find projects that demonstrate my proficiency in data cleaning. I employ techniques such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and validating data against predefined rules. Through these projects, I ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data, enabling trustworthy analysis and insights.

**Data Visualization**

The projects in this section highlight my expertise in data visualization. I employ various visualization techniques, including charts, graphs, and maps, to represent complex datasets in an intuitive and visually appealing manner. By transforming data into compelling visualizations, I facilitate the communication of patterns, trends, and insights, empowering stakeholders to understand and make informed decisions based on the data.

**Pivot Tables**

In this section, you will find projects that showcase my proficiency in leveraging pivot tables. I use this powerful feature in spreadsheet software, such as Microsoft Excel, to efficiently organize and summarize large datasets. Through drag-and-drop functionality, I create custom summaries, perform calculations, and explore relationships and patterns within the data. These projects exemplify my ability to derive valuable insights from complex datasets using pivot tables.

**Formulas in Excel**

The projects in this section demonstrate my expertise in utilizing formulas in Microsoft Excel. I leverage a wide range of built-in functions and operators to perform calculations, manipulate data, and automate repetitive tasks. By employing formulas effectively, I enhance data analysis, perform statistical calculations, and streamline data processing. These projects exemplify my ability to harness the power of Excel formulas to drive efficient and accurate data analytics.

**Analysis**

In this section, you will find projects that showcase my skills in data analysis. Using statistical techniques, data mining algorithms, and machine learning models, I extract valuable insights and make predictions from datasets. Through exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and other methods, I provide actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making. These projects demonstrate my ability to uncover meaningful patterns and trends within data.
